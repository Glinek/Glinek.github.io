## Hii, I'm Simon
### Who am I?
I'm a 19yo robotics engineering student and a maker.   
In school I mainly program PLCs (we have siemens s7-1200s) and industrial robots (in labs there are two kuka's KR 4 R600, one Kuka KR16 and three ABB collaborative robots).   
And at home I love programming Arduinos/ESPs/RaspberryPis, 3D printing (my current 3d printer is Ender-3 S1 Pro). In general just making stuff. Besides project I have also created ANUab. Right now It's just my place to host projects made with my friends or alone (It's looks and feels good to work on projects under some brand).
### I am experienced in...
* ...Programming PLCs. Except for Siemens' PLCs in my school I have programmed Astraada ONE Compact in Codesys and Beckhoff Industrial PCs in TwinCat 3
* ...Programming PLCs to communicate with Robots. I have done a 1 month long internship, where my task was to program Astraada one to communicate with K-Roset via TCP/IP and then later via .DLL communication protocol provided by Kawasaki.
* ...Programming in general. My language of choice for most things remains Python (3.10 or 3.7 cause newer version suck and luck libraries I need), but I am trying to switch to C#. I also know the basics of C++ thanks to Arduino and a little bit of C.
* ...Designing 3D models. As you might have seen, most of my projects are 3D printed and in 2022ish I have moved from tinkercad to Fusion 360 and now (feb. 2025) I am switching my cad software once again. This time it's Freecad, mainly bc it works on linux.
* ...Making PCBs. That is a skill I am still learning but for over a year now (feb. 2025) I have been designing PCBs in KiCad for various projects
* ...Creating electrical installations. In 2023 I successfully got eligibility to work with installations to 1kV
* ...Servicing heavy machinery. For a few years now I have been regularly maintaining dozers, diggers, loaders and tractors
### What I use to make stuff - Software
* [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) - for creating 3D models, since version 1.0 It's working rly nice, though it's not beginner friendly.
* [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/) - for making schematics and PCBs, has some downsides but is the best free tool, and it also runs on Linux.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - for coding, the best IDE there is.
* [Arduino IDE 2](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) - for programming Arduino, Pi Pico and ESP32
* Other software to keep me organized([Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)), slice my 3D models([Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/)) and make backups([Kopia](https://kopia.io))
### What I use to make stuff - Hardware
* 3D printer, I can't express how much this helps with creating something
* Decent soldering station (soldering iron with hot air), to solder everything
* Lab bench power supply and a multimeter, used all of the time to work with electronic circuits.
* Basic tools, such as screwdrivers, wire strippers, tweezers, a pair of calipers, knife, wire cutters, etc.

## My organization - ANUlab
### What is ANUlab?
Anulab (or ANU for short) is an organization created by me in the beginning of 2022. As I said/wrote earlier, right now It's a place to host/post my projects and ones created with my friends, e.g. Hackathon projects.
### Future of ANUlab and my vision for it
I have envisioned ANU. to be a company that sells tools, but not a regular company. Its goal is going to be educating people on making SoMetHiNG themselves and providing tools for it. I would like ANUlab to have two main branches:
* products - actual products that are gonna be sold, tools for makers such as desktop CNCs, multifunction multimeters (this sound weird...).
* free projects - at the moment I have one in mind. A website where tutorials and courses for creating projects, learning programming and more are gonna be posted for free.
The future of ANUlab depends on what the next year will bring. My friend and I are working on ANUlab's first product, [Otsi](https://glinek.tech/projects/otsi_mk2/)
### ANUlab's github
On [ANUlab's github{{< icon "github" >}}](https://github.com/A-N-Ulab) you can find many of my projects, e.g. Otsi and Atrovel are documented there.

## (T)otally (N)ot (S)uspicious (T)eam
Is a team of my friends and me that was originally created as a joke during one contest but then became something more serious. Right now we, as a team, have participated in one hackathon and are looking forward to new experiences and new people. Currently hosted under the hood of ANUlab
