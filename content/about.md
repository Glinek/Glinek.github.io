## Hii, I'm Simon
### Who am I?
I'm a 19yo robotics engineering student and a maker.   
In school I mainly program PLCs (we have siemens s7-1200s) and industrial robots (in labs there are two kuka's KR 4 R600, one Kuka KR16 and three ABB collaborative robots).   
And at home I love programming Arduinos/ESPs/RaspberryPis, 3D printing (my current 3d printer is Ender-3 S1 Pro). In general just making stuff. Besides project I have also created ANUab. Right now It's just my place to host projects made with my friends or alone (It's looks and feels better to work on projects under some brand).
### I am experienced in...
* ...Programming PLCs. Except for Siemens' PLCs in my school I have programmed Astraada ONE Compact in Codesys and Beckhoff Industrial PCs in TwinCat 3
* ...Programming industrial robots. In my school I have been programming ABB and KUKA robots and in July 2024 I have done one month internship where I learned to program Astorino and Kawasaki robots
* ...Programming in general. My language of choice for most things remains Python (3.10 or 3.7 cause newer version suck and luck libraries I need), but I am trying to switch to C#. I also know the basics of C++ thanks to Arduino and a little bit of C.
* ...Designing 3D models. As you might have seen, most of my projects are 3D printed and in 2022ish I have moved from tinkercad to Fusion 360 and now (feb. 2025) I am switching my cad software once again. This time it's Freecad, mainly bc it works on linux.
* ...Making PCBs. That is a skill I am still learning but for over a year now (feb. 2025) I have been designing PCBs in KiCad for various projects
* ...Creating electrical installations. In 2023 I successfully got eligibility to work with installations to 1kV
* ...Servicing heavy machinery. For a few years now I have been regularly maintaining dozers, diggers, loaders and tractors
### What I use to make stuff - Software
* [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) - for creating 3D models, since version 1.0 It's working rly nice, though it's not beginner friendly.
* [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/) - for making schematics and PCBs, has some downsides but is the best free tool, and it also runs on Linux.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - for coding, the best IDE there is.
* [Arduino IDE 2](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) - for programming Arduino, Pi Pico and ESP32
* Other software to keep me organized([Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)), slice my 3D models([Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/)) and make backups([Kopia](https://kopia.io))
### What I use to make stuff - Hardware
* 3D printer, I can't express how much this helps with creating something
* Decent soldering station (soldering iron with hot air), to solder everything
* Lab bench power supply and a multimeter, used all of the time to work with electronic circuits.
* Basic tools, such as screwdrivers, wire strippers, tweezers, a pair of calipers, knife, wire cutters, etc. In general everything essential for a maker

## My organization - ANUlab
You will see that many of my projects while being made by me have label on them `ANUlab`, that's bc I prefere to make my projects under some brand.

### What is ANUlab?
Anulab (or ANU for short) is an organization created by me in the beginning of 2022. As I said/wrote earlier, right now It's a place to host/post my projects and ones created with my friends, e.g. Hackathon projects.

**That is all there is about me. I wish you the very best and I'm hoping to see you here again later**
