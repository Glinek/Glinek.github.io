Otsi is my passionate project that originated from [Cyberdeck Cafe's](https://cyberdeck.cafe/) contest for cyberpet and right now I am making an improved version with my friend that is going to have significant improvements over [Otsi.mk1](/projects/Otsi). As written above details about Otsi.mk2 have been moved to ANUlab's own website (link [here](https://anulab.glinek.tech/projects/otsi.mk2/otsi-info/).
