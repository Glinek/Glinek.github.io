## Motivation
This project was created in my school as a way to help my classmates and me program robots while we don't have phisical access to them. And also as an excuse to program something in RobotStudio.

## Goal
The main goal of this project is to have an accurate, or should I say semi-accurate representation of my school's robots that includes all the lights that can be controlled, conveyor, gripper and maybe some way to move pieces in the simulation
