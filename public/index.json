This project is WORK IN PROGRESS! Even though my PicoCalc\u0026rsquo;s custom back is made, the software is still being developed.\rPicoCalc by ClockworkPi is an amazing kit. But for my needs it lacks a few things, like how am I supposed to make a custom handheld system without RTC? Impossible\u0026hellip; Thankfully Clockwork shares all the files on their github so it\u0026rsquo;s fairly easy to add custom boards. Another thing, have you seen its software? Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, PicoMite is incredible, why would you use BASIC in 2025 though? So I\u0026rsquo;m also making new software\u0026hellip; But let\u0026rsquo;s not get ahead of myself. Let\u0026rsquo;s, for now, focus on hardware\nThings added - hardware #\rAlright, PicoCalc comes equipped with 320x320px 4-inch IPS screen, QWERTY backlit keyboard, speakers and 3.5mm audio jack and an SD card reader all powered by Raspberry Pi Pico H (yes, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what it\u0026rsquo;s said on the website). And that\u0026rsquo;s great, It\u0026rsquo;s plenty enough for a good handheld, but for my needs it lacks:\nRTC Environmental sensors, this includes thermometer, hygrometer and a barometer IMUs, magnetometer and an accelometer-gyro combo to be exact Extension port for I2C devices High power LED (bc I can) WiFi and bluetooth, thankfully I can swap Pico H for Pico 2W And last bat not least, a place for the allen key that comes with the PicoCalc So that\u0026rsquo;s what I did, I added all of those to my PicoCalc, lucky it has A LOT of unused space inside.\nCase #\rBut adding that stuff is one thing, another thing is mounting them inside. And that took me 2 tries. At first I used the awesome back replacement by n602 on Thingiverse (here is a link: Replacement bottom part for PicoCalc on Thingiverse). And I have modified it heavily to fit all I wanted. Just without the LED and extension port, that idea came to my mind later. And I printed this case in my beloved turquoise PETG But a few weeks later I had a genius idea to add an extension port developed for my other project - Otsi.mk2, high power LED as well as a mysterious port for something I will talk about in a minute. But at that point I wasn\u0026rsquo;t totally sure if I wanted to change all of it. Soldering took a long time and I wanted to just program my PicoCalc. But after finding Kelpiscool\u0026rsquo;s work on github I had to make it. Kelpiscool made an awesome modular back for PicoCalc that is much more flexible than n602\u0026rsquo;s design (here you have a link: PicoCalc modular back on Github). So I have spent a lot of time designing the new Back and finally here it is. Printed in beautiful bottle green and mat black. TBH I think it looks better than the turquoise one. I also thought that it would be nice to show the comparison between the original back by ClockworkPi and my 2 attempts so here you have it: Original on the left, my first attempt in the center and my current version on the right.\nSoftware #\rThe software is something special. Bc of PicoCalc being basically a glorified Raspberry Pi Pico I have been programming it in Arduino IDE (bc it\u0026rsquo;s better than micropython\u0026hellip;). My main goals for PicoCalc OS (named Otion-OS) are:\nDisplaying data from all the sensors in a convenient way Having a notepad Having google calendar and weather forecast integrated Can\u0026rsquo;t forget about the calculator, this includes: Regular calculator Scientific calculator Trigonometry calculator + pitagoras triangle calculator (I use it a lot) Proportion calculator (Also using it a lot) Unit conversion Wire thickness calculator Additionally everything that the I2C module outputs And something special, remember that mysterious port from earlier? That is for thermal printer, so my PicoCalc is going to be a printer as well. And those are my plans, as of today (10.07.2025) I have made the main menu and will now proceed into making widgets (google calendar and weather forecast, those two blank rectangles). Below you have a few photos showing current progress: Last words #\rCurrently I\u0026rsquo;m not sharing any files for my mods for PicoCalc, mainly bc I don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to work on all the instructions and bc it uses a lot of other people\u0026rsquo;s projects and dealing with the licenses would be a nightmare. Hope you understand. But if you want some advice or maybe even some files don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to massage me! At last here are some photos I took while soldering the second case: That\u0026rsquo;s all, thank you soooo much for reading all of this. Hope to see you again!

So if you are reading this, bc you want to make your own photo-frame, you are in the right place.\n#\rMaking one for yourself #\rTarget device #\rThis project has been designed for Raspberry Pi Pico W with ILI9341 display so keep in mind that this tutorial will focus on Pico W. But feel free to modify it to your own needs.\nCode #\rMake sure to download all the libraries needed for this project to work, I do this by compiling the code and then installing libraries that caused an error. Important Don\u0026rsquo;t download the DHT11 library from the library manager, copy files from Code/library for dht11 from repo and paste it into your Arduino Libraries folder. Or you can modify the code to work with other libraries\rAfter successfully installing all libraries, change:\nssid* to your networks ID/Name password* to your networks password totalPhotos to number of photos you want to be displayed After you have done all of that, you are ready to upload code to Pico W. You may need to change this code to display your local time, right now it is set to UTC and UTC+1. Wiring #\rConnect your display to SPI0 of your Pico, you may follow this tutorial from electronoobs about connecting ILI9341 to an arduino Connect SD card to SPI1 of Pico Connect DHT11\u0026rsquo;s data pin to pin 5 of your Pico Connect your button to Pico\u0026rsquo;s pin 9 I gave also added a switch on ILI9341\u0026rsquo;s LED line to be able to turn off the screen Creating bitmaps #\rThis is an important step, you have to convert your photos to a 24 bit bitmap. I was using gimp. Here are some important things you have to remember:\nSet height to 320px Set width to 240px When exporting your photo to bitmap (.bmp) remember to export it as a 24 bit bitmap! Otherwise it won\u0026rsquo;t work name your photos starting from 1, e.g. 1.bmp and so on Then upload all your photos to your SD card, on your SD card you should create a folder named Photos. That is the place for all your bitmaps. Case #\rIf you wish, in the repo I have included files for the case I designed and 3D printed. You have .stl files and files for freecad if you want to edit something about them. Keep in mind that it may not suit you.\nUsage #\rWhen pluged in, you should see an Axolotl, current time, day of the week, date, temperature and humidity. This is the main menu screen. To see your photo press the button. Your photo will be displayed. To go back to main menu press the button again. If you wish to change time from winter to summer or summer to winter, hold down the button when in main menu for 2 seconds.\nCredits #\rcode for displaying bitmaps is based on work of Rarday on adafruit forum but with slight modifications so it works getting time from webserver is based on work of tehniq3 on github dht11 library, sadly I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find who made this library, but when I do, I will post it here to give appropriate credits. Gallery #\rLast words #\rI hope I have helped someone trying to make a Photo-frame themselves or someone just trying to display bitmap\u0026rsquo;s on ILI9341.

It was never meant to even exist, but two factors changed my mind: the new Raspberry Pi and the fact that the first Obsium just stopped working. So I ordered Pi5 and waited almost 3 months. It\u0026rsquo;s wild how long It took\u0026hellip; Anyways, while my Pi was being shipped, I ordered M2 hat for it and started work on the design. At first the plan was to use an old case and just modify It, but I ended up creating a whole new case with some tweaks. new (left) and old (right) case comparison\nObsium #\rSpecs #\rObsium mk2 is powered by 8GB version of Raspberry Pi 5 with 512GB Samsung SSD and a 12ish inch Full HD screen.\rBattery #\rBattery is a huge improvement. Mk2 has a replaceable battery and every battery module has It\u0026rsquo;s own 4S bms and 4x2000mAh Li-Ion cells. That gives about 2.5h of work time on a single battery pack.\nKeyboard #\rKeyboard is the same one as on mk1. It\u0026rsquo;s a custom ortholinear keyboard with brown cherry switches. I/Os #\rObsium has rather specific I/O, apart from the obvious ethernet, usb and audio jack, mk2 has an external port for connecting different antennas to built-in SDR. It also has external SATA and a port for powering disk\u0026rsquo;s. With the custom cable connecting HDD drives is no problem. What has changed #\rMany things have changed. Apart from mentioned battery and Pi, the new case is much more comfortable to use, the I/O is also a huge improvement compared to mk1. But what Obsium mk2 lacks compared to mk1 is the integrated LoRa. Last vast improvements are friction hinges. I can\u0026rsquo;t express how much using Obsium has improved with those.\nSecond monitor #\rThanks to having an external 12V port I was able to make a second monitor that could be powered entirely by Obsium. Stats screen #\rAbout a month after finishing Obsium I decided to add a 64x128px OLED display to show me basic stats and the temperature. Can It replace a laptop? #\rNo. Short answer is no. I have been daily driving Obsium for a while. Then I managed to buy a laptop and there are a few things that I have noticed. But before that, a little disclaimer. Comparing cyberdecks to laptops is kinda pointless bc laptops are always gonna be better. Anyway, what I have noticed is that having ARM instead of x86 is a problem. I am not saying that It\u0026rsquo;s a huge issue. But It\u0026rsquo;s a problem, especially for me now when I need to program PLC\u0026rsquo;s and Codesys or TwinCat is only available for x86 windows. Another thing is size, when It sits on a desk or is in a big backpack the thickness is not a problem. But e.g. when I want to take a smaller backpack Obsium takes most of the space. Last thing are thermals. Pi5 has awful thermals and for extended usage at 100% I would be afraid that sth might burn. But apart from that It might be a great computer for somebody that wants to write something from time to time at school or just have the ability to watch a movie or scroll through the internet on a bigger screen and an actual desktop. It\u0026rsquo;s also a great way to learn a lot about electronics, 3D design, linux and more. Last words #\rBoth Obsiums were great projects and I have learned a ton. I definitely won\u0026rsquo;t disassemble this Obsium, It has Its own place in my heart and I just love It too much. Yes, It\u0026rsquo;s not super powerful. Yes, I have a laptop now.

In September of 2023 the announcement was made that a contest for a cyberpet is being hosted. We got only a few requirements so we could unleash our creativity. And mine went like crazy. After a few months of hard work, I submitted my design and won!\nFunctionalities #\rFor me cyberpet should be your personal helper, just a friendly pet taken with you everywhere that can help you with your everyday tasks. Because I\u0026rsquo;m more into programming and electronics, Otsi was supposed to have a built- in multimeter, flashlight, calculator and more. Not every idea became reality but that\u0026rsquo;s where Otsi mk2 comes in, more about it later. So what are the features of Otsi at the moment you might ask. So the functionalities are:\nThermometer and hygrometer Built-in 3W LED Timer and stoper RTC module wifi scanner There are a few not completed functionalities like:\na calculator lora communication but they are not gonna be added. Maybe after creating mk2, but with huge MAYBE Otsi\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;emotions\u0026rdquo; #\rOtsi sleeps between 10pm and 6am, you can interrupt her but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t advice doing that. Besides that she needs to be taken care of, exposed to sunlight. Also Otsi is a little attention queen so make sure to give it to her. If any of the stats drop below predefined threshold she will start being less and less responsive, tired and unhappy. To calm you, she can not die, Otsi can just be exhausted.\nDesign #\rAfter having the code like 90% completed i started working on the design. As you can see from the photos, It is quite unique. Render front Render back This design was made so that you can comfortably hold Otsi with your right hand and operate the encoder with your left hand. Creating your own #\rWarning! Otsi is not a beginner friendly build. You have to have a lot of patience and soldering skills.\rTo create your own Otsi, follow the instructions provided in Otsi\u0026rsquo;s github\r.\nKnow problems #\rThe one problem that I managed to find is that the timer doesn\u0026rsquo;t work correctly countdowns above a few minutes. It will be fixed with mk2\nLast words #\rOtsi has been a great project to vastly improve my arduino coding skills. This project wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been possible without the awesome people from Cyberdeck Cafe. Especially Helix.\nStay creative and keep improving #\r~Simon #\r","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/otsi/","section":"My Projects","summary":"Otsi is a winning design of a cyberpet made for Cyberdeck Cafe\u0026rsquo;s contest.

We were learning arduino\u0026rsquo;s for a while at that moment. And that day\u0026rsquo;s assignment was learning how to read from a 4x4 button matrix. I, knowing a little bit about arduino, was bored a little bit. So to keep myself \u0026ldquo;entertained\u0026rdquo; I started work on a calculator. Nothing serious, not even doing real calculations, just displaying equations on a serial monitor. But then. after 3 hours of making it, I started to wonder. Could I make an actual calculator? I had to know. The same day, after coming back home, every other project went aside and work on this calculator began. My style of working on projects like this is splitting them into two main tasks: programming and case/electronics. And, as always, programming went first. Atrovel\u0026rsquo;s code might be a little bit rough around the edges, and not optimized as much as I would like. Despite that it works. I would even dare to say that It works quite well. Anyways, after a week of coding and debugging. The code was done and now I had to start working on the enclosure. My first idea was using MX cherry switches but after 5h long print this case turned out waaaaay too big. So I decided on using the original 4x4 button matrix with two additional ones. After stuffing all the electronics inside and closing It with a little amount of force (jk, a lot of force\u0026hellip;) and super glue, came the time to test It. And oh boy have I tested It. One month of using it in school while doing math and physics exams. And all the calculations were correct.\nProblems #\rThere are two main problems with Atrovel. The buttons are kinda shitty, and you have to remember the layout. Another thing is that you are unable to calculate e.g. 2+2 and then make a square root of it. You have to type 4 and then press square root. Will I fix those? Probably not. But Atrovel\u0026rsquo;s spaghetti code will probably be used in another iteration of Otsi\nMaking your own #\rTo create your own Atrovel, just follow the instructions on It\u0026rsquo;s github (link above). If you decide to make your own, I hope it will serve you well. And if you want, you can send your finished calculator to me. I would be delighted to see It\nGallery #\rStay creative #\r~Simon #\r","date":"15 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/atrovel-calculator/","section":"My Projects","summary":"Atrovel calculator is a project that originated from one of my schools lessons.","title":"Atrovel calculator","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"15 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/calculator/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Calculator","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rLinks #\rWallpaper Hackaday.io page Hackster.io\u0026rsquo;s article Cyberdeck Cafe\u0026rsquo;s website Cyberdeck Cafe\u0026rsquo;s discord yarh.io - the keyboard design But why? #\rLet\u0026rsquo;s start with a little bit of story behind creating Obsium. It\u0026rsquo;s not my first deck, in fact it\u0026rsquo;s my 8th deck. But why make so many isn\u0026rsquo;t it easier to buy a laptop? - you may ask. Yes it is but the reason for building decks for past 2 years and spending all my money on it was to built something that fits all MY needs and maybe learn something while doing it. So i decided that my last deck has to have:\na big-ish battery exposed gpio my digital oscilloscope LoRa (Long Range messenger) sdr And it has to be flexible. All my previous decks have failed at at least one of this points. But now I\u0026rsquo;ve a deck with all that features (not all i wanted at the beginning but all I mentioned). Yes it\u0026rsquo;s big and Yes laptops are more powerful and I probably could have got away with just taking an additional Arduino with me all the time but i am a masochist that has a 3d printer and some skills. Fusion360 go brrrrr #\rDesigning process wasn\u0026rsquo;t as easy as i have hopped. What i have right now is the second version of Obsium. The first one was cooler but not practical at all. So in the middle of printing and designing I scraped everything and started all over again. I have hoped that my last deck would be thinner but i didn\u0026rsquo;t want to order another PCB and wait another month. Besides that current design incorporates (in my opinion) everything pretty well. old design\nnew design\nI need more I/O #\rOn the left side I have charging port for my custom charger, main switch to power Obsium on and a button to turn on and off the display. The back side has one battery indicator, antena for LoRa and one removable panel with ports and gpios.\rThe right side has a fan switch and is going to have an antena for 100MHz-1GHz SDR And finally the front, It has a label and 2 Allen keys Looking at it from the top you can see a fan, an offset keyboard and a small, not even 1inch LCD.\rA huge time saviour while making Obsium turned out to be using plexi for everything large and flat. It also made Obsium really rigged although i won\u0026rsquo;t throw it around.\nThe inside #\rThe inside might look, at first glance, as one big mess but It\u0026rsquo;s actually a well organized and thought through arrangement of cables. Another huge savior is the PCB I\u0026rsquo;m using cause it allows for a lot of connections (just like every PCB\u0026hellip;) without any extra mess. Although if I could turn back time I would do It differently, sadly from the back ports only the Ethernet is working. Theoretically HDMI is also working but, there has to be some lose connection cause it sometimes lacks a few colors. Also the USB is working but as 2.0 and not 3.0. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why the ports have failed, I have checked all of them before putting this board inside but It still managed to break itself. Now I have to live with that. Specs #\rObsium is powered by a rather unusual raspberry pi 400 board with a M.2 SSD connected via USB 3.0. Powering everything is battery pack made out of 4 Li-ion cells in 4s configuration giving around 40Wh and 16.8V. As a keyboard Obsium is using custom made ortholinear design and configuration by yarh.io but with a few tweaks. Last words #\rFor the next few weeks i\u0026rsquo;m going to be debugging this deck. I have to check GPIO\u0026rsquo;s, LoRa, oscilloscope (that\u0026rsquo;s what the Raspberry Pi Pico is for), SDR and the mini LCD. I would also like to thank Cyberdeck Cafe discord members and my discord friends for all the support and help with making this deck.\n","date":"1 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/obsium/","section":"My Projects","summary":"Cyberdecks serve a different purpose for everybody.

Tbh I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I have decided to make It, I have never actually used it besides while testing it for the contest.\nHow it works #\rOne-key keyboard (or okk. for short) works by measuring how much light is emitted by the LED onto a photoresistor, while the key is not pressed, the LED is not covered so all the light can shine onto the photoresistor. But when it is pressed by some amount, the key starts blocking some of the light so the photoresistor\u0026rsquo;s resistance changes. And when this photoresistor is connected with another one, and voltage divider is created by them. You can measure this resistance difference (or, to be more accurate, now a voltage drop) with arduino\u0026rsquo;s analog pin. The code can be as short as just a few lines. Additionally I have added another screen, cause It makes okk. look better and also everything nowadays has to have a screen.\nMake your own #\rWhy would you even want to make your own version? Never mind\u0026hellip; Good-ish documentation can be found on okk.\u0026rsquo;s github page.

In general just making stuff. Besides project I have also created ANUab. Right now It\u0026rsquo;s just my place to host projects made with my friends or alone (It\u0026rsquo;s looks and feels better to work on projects under some brand).\nI am experienced in\u0026hellip; #\r\u0026hellip;Programming PLCs. Except for Siemens\u0026rsquo; PLCs in my school I have programmed Astraada ONE Compact in Codesys and Beckhoff Industrial PCs in TwinCat 3 \u0026hellip;Programming industrial robots. In my school I have been programming ABB and KUKA robots and in July 2024 I have done one month internship where I learned to program Astorino and Kawasaki robots \u0026hellip;Programming in general. My language of choice for most things remains Python (3.10 or 3.7 cause newer version suck and luck libraries I need), but I am trying to switch to C#. I also know the basics of C++ thanks to Arduino and a little bit of C. \u0026hellip;Designing 3D models. As you might have seen, most of my projects are 3D printed and in 2022ish I have moved from tinkercad to Fusion 360 and now (feb. 2025) I am switching my cad software once again. This time it\u0026rsquo;s Freecad, mainly bc it works on linux. \u0026hellip;Making PCBs. That is a skill I am still learning but for over a year now (feb. 2025) I have been designing PCBs in KiCad for various projects \u0026hellip;Creating electrical installations. In 2023 I successfully got eligibility to work with installations to 1kV \u0026hellip;Servicing heavy machinery. For a few years now I have been regularly maintaining dozers, diggers, loaders and tractors What I use to make stuff - Software #\rFreeCAD - for creating 3D models, since version 1.0 It\u0026rsquo;s working rly nice, though it\u0026rsquo;s not beginner friendly. KiCAD - for making schematics and PCBs, has some downsides but is the best free tool, and it also runs on Linux. Visual Studio Code - for coding, the best IDE there is. Arduino IDE 2 - for programming Arduino, Pi Pico and ESP32 Other software to keep me organized(Obsidian), slice my 3D models(Cura) and make backups(Kopia) What I use to make stuff - Hardware #\r3D printer, I can\u0026rsquo;t express how much this helps with creating something Decent soldering station (soldering iron with hot air), to solder everything Lab bench power supply and a multimeter, used all of the time to work with electronic circuits. Basic tools, such as screwdrivers, wire strippers, tweezers, a pair of calipers, knife, wire cutters, etc. In general everything essential for a maker My organization - ANUlab #\rYou will see that many of my projects while being made by me have label on them ANUlab, that\u0026rsquo;s bc I prefere to make my projects under some brand.\nWhat is ANUlab? #\rAnulab (or ANU for short) is an organization created by me in the beginning of 2022. As I said/wrote earlier, right now It\u0026rsquo;s a place to host/post my projects and ones created with my friends, e.g. Hackathon projects.\nANUlab\u0026rsquo;s website #\rClick here to go to ANUlab\u0026rsquo;s website where you will find project created by my fiends and me.
