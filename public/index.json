Seriously, arguing with them over a stupid thing was hilarious and I enjoyed every part of it.\nOur photo, missing two people tho\u0026hellip;\nOur code #\rWhat we made was an app that is designed to help you with choosing your travel destination. It’s very tinder-like bc this mechanic is very underrated but great when it goes to UX and data you can get from it. The idea was that we would show a few places to get to know user preferences and then after that we would start displaying actual examples. The problem was classifying places and our solution was grouping locations based on their features like (proximity of a body of water, orientality of a places, average altitude, etc)\nMe while coding, an actuall test of Cition Portable\nFunny story #\rFunny story, when we were uploading our code for scoring we saw that our app was given 3.4 / 5 but it was before the 24 had even passed.

This is also one of the projects made out of necessity. It was mainly created to improve my experience while working in various CAD softwares. Hence the numpad on the left though I’m right-handed. While using CAD I use my mouse almost for everything except for inputting dimensions. While I had my numpad on the right I had to swap between using a mouse or a numpad (left hand was useless, SO INEFFICIENT). Now I can comfortably use both at the same time. Features I have already mentioned one of the features. Numpad on the left. But some might notice that there is also a small display and a weird power switch. That’s bc this numpad is also a CALCULATOR. And that rocker switch is used to change between calculator and numpad.\nHardware components #\rComponent Description Quantity Notes Keyboard A keyboard, 75% works best for me, you can make one yourself or by one like I did 1x I bought my keyboard from Baigel Labs on Tindie and it’s great!

While programming PicoCalc I encountered a simple issue, how to save data on Arduino (in this case Pi Pico) so that even after a restart that data will still be there, without using an SD card. The answer is very simple, you should use EEPROM. And that’s what I thought immediately BUT as it turns out Pi Pico only has the built-in EEPROM library which allows you to save 4096 bytes of data by changing the value of each byte. And that’s a problem and that’s how this library was born. I needed a way to save data into EEPROM and the solution was non-existent so I made it myself and shared the solution for everybody to use.\nFeatures #\rThis library is able to save and read Integers, Strings (with dynamic length defined by user and a static length of 20 characters) and Booleans.\nTarget device #\rThis project is targeted ONLY for boards from Arduino-Pico library, this means every board with RP2040 and RP235x chip.\nDocs #\rMax allowed EEPROM size 4096 bytes, in this documentation each byte is going to be referred to as address because we need to specify at which byte we will save the data.\nInitializing library #\rAt the beginning of your Arduino program you need to initialize this library and create an object e.g.:\n#include \u0026lt;picoEEPROM.h\u0026gt; picoEEPROM picoEEPROM; Functions #\rbegin(eeprom_size) #\rbegin function takes one argument - size of eeprom, max allowed size is 4096. begin function returns 0 if everything worked and 1 if eeprom size is invalid. E.g.\npicoEEPROM.begin(4096); //begin eeprom with it\u0026#39;s max allowed size putEmptyByte(address) #\rputEmptyByte puts one empty byte at a specified address\npicoEEPROM.putEmptyByte(0); putEmptyBytes(num_of_bytes, address) #\rputEmptyBytes takes two arguments, number of empty bytes and starting address. It puts a specified number of empty bytes starting at a given address.\npicoEEPROM.putEmptyBytes(7, 1); putInt(value, address) #\rputInt takes two arguments, integer value and EEPROM address. Important! This function takes 4 bytes/4 EEPROM addresses to store one integer starting at a given address. putInt returns 1 if value is out of range, 2 if commiting to eeprom failed and 0 if everything worked.\npicoEEPROM.putInt(555, 0); //puts int = 555 starting at address 0 getInt(address) #\rgetInt() takes one argument, EEPROM address (the same address as in putInt). This function returns int read from EEPROM. If something is wrong with retrieved int check if the correct address is specified.\nint valueRead = picoEEPROM.getInt(0); //reads int from address 0 putBool(value, bit, address) #\rputBool takes three arguments, boolean value, bit at which value will be stored and EEPROM address. This function returns 1 if bit is not between 0-7, 2 if commiting to eeprom failed and 0 if everything worked,\npicoEEPROM.putBool(true, 0, 5); //saving false at bit 0 at EEPROM address 5 getBool(bit, address) #\rgetBool takes 2 arguments, bit at which value is stored and EEPROM address. This function returns a boolean value read from EEPROM.\nbool boolRead = picoEEPROM.getBool(0, 5); //reads bool from bit 0 at EEPROM address 5 putString20(value, address) #\rputString20 takes two arguments, string value and EEPROM address. This function will always take 20 bytes from EEPROM to save a given string even if it\u0026rsquo;s e.g. 4 characters long. Keep this in mind when allocating addresses. This function returns 1 if the string is larger than 20, 2 if committing to EEPROM failed and 0 if everything worked.\npicoEEPROM.putString20(\u0026#34;testingStuff\u0026#34;, 6); //puts string starting at address 6 getString20(address) #\rgetString20 takes one argument, EEPROM address and returns a string read starting at that address.\nString firstStringRead = picoEEPROM.getString20(6); //reads string stored at addresses 6 to 26 putString(value, address) #\rputString takes 2 arguments, string of any value smaller than 4096 bytes and EEPROM address. This function returns 1 if string is larger than 4096, 2 if committing to EEPROM failed and String length! if everything worked. This data can be used with getString function.\nint stringLength = picoEEPROM.putString(\u0026#34;this string is longer than 20 characters\u0026#34;, 27) //puts string starting at address 27 getString(string_size, address) #\rgetString takes 2 arguments, string length and EEPROM address. String length is returned when saving a given string to eeprom using the putString function. This function returns a string read from EEPROM.\nString secondStringRead = picoEEPROM.getString(stringLength, 27); //reads string stored at addresses 27 to 27+stringLength ","date":"18 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/picoeeprom/","section":"My Projects","summary":"picoEEPROM is library developed by me to simplify usage of EEPROM with Arduino-Pico boards","title":"picoEEPROM library","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"9 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cyberdeck/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cyberdeck","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pi-pico/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pi Pico","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rInfo! This project is WORK IN PROGRESS! Even though my PicoCalc\u0026rsquo;s custom back is made, the software is still being developed.\rPicoCalc by ClockworkPi is an amazing kit. But for my needs it lacks a few things, like how am I supposed to make a custom handheld system without RTC? Impossible\u0026hellip; Thankfully Clockwork shares all the files on their github so it\u0026rsquo;s fairly easy to add custom boards. Another thing, have you seen its software? Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, PicoMite is incredible, why would you use BASIC in 2025 though? So I\u0026rsquo;m also making new software\u0026hellip; But let\u0026rsquo;s not get ahead of myself. Let\u0026rsquo;s, for now, focus on hardware\nThings added - hardware #\rAlright, PicoCalc comes equipped with 320x320px 4-inch IPS screen, QWERTY backlit keyboard, speakers and 3.5mm audio jack and an SD card reader all powered by Raspberry Pi Pico H (yes, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what it\u0026rsquo;s said on the website). And that\u0026rsquo;s great, It\u0026rsquo;s plenty enough for a good handheld, but for my needs it lacks:\nRTC Environmental sensors, this includes thermometer, hygrometer and a barometer IMUs, magnetometer and an accelometer-gyro combo to be exact Extension port for I2C devices High power LED (bc I can) WiFi and bluetooth, thankfully I can swap Pico H for Pico 2W And last bat not least, a place for the allen key that comes with the PicoCalc So that\u0026rsquo;s what I did, I added all of those to my PicoCalc, lucky it has A LOT of unused space inside.\nCase #\rBut adding that stuff is one thing, another thing is mounting them inside. And that took me 2 tries. At first I used the awesome back replacement by n602 on Thingiverse (here is a link: Replacement bottom part for PicoCalc on Thingiverse). And I have modified it heavily to fit all I wanted. Just without the LED and extension port, that idea came to my mind later. And I printed this case in my beloved turquoise PETG But a few weeks later I had a genius idea to add an extension port developed for my other project - Otsi.mk2, high power LED as well as a mysterious port for something I will talk about in a minute. But at that point I wasn\u0026rsquo;t totally sure if I wanted to change all of it. Soldering took a long time and I wanted to just program my PicoCalc. But after finding Kelpiscool\u0026rsquo;s work on github I had to make it. Kelpiscool made an awesome modular back for PicoCalc that is much more flexible than n602\u0026rsquo;s design (here you have a link: PicoCalc modular back on Github). So I have spent a lot of time designing the new Back and finally here it is. Printed in beautiful bottle green and mat black. TBH I think it looks better than the turquoise one. I also thought that it would be nice to show the comparison between the original back by ClockworkPi and my 2 attempts so here you have it: Original on the left, my first attempt in the center and my current version on the right.\nSoftware #\rThe software is something special. Bc of PicoCalc being basically a glorified Raspberry Pi Pico I have been programming it in Arduino IDE (bc it\u0026rsquo;s better than micropython\u0026hellip;). My main goals for PicoCalc OS (named Otion-OS) are:\nDisplaying data from all the sensors in a convenient way Having a notepad Having google calendar and weather forecast integrated Can\u0026rsquo;t forget about the calculator, this includes: Regular calculator Scientific calculator Trigonometry calculator + pitagoras triangle calculator (I use it a lot) Proportion calculator (Also using it a lot) Unit conversion Wire thickness calculator Additionally everything that the I2C module outputs And something special, remember that mysterious port from earlier? That is for thermal printer, so my PicoCalc is going to be a printer as well. And those are my plans, as of today (10.07.2025) I have made the main menu and will now proceed into making widgets (google calendar and weather forecast, those two blank rectangles). Below you have a few photos showing current progress: Last words #\rCurrently I\u0026rsquo;m not sharing any files for my mods for PicoCalc, mainly bc I don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to work on all the instructions and bc it uses a lot of other people\u0026rsquo;s projects and dealing with the licenses would be a nightmare. Hope you understand. But if you want some advice or maybe even some files don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to massage me! At last here are some photos I took while soldering the second case: That\u0026rsquo;s all, thank you soooo much for reading all of this. Hope to see you again!

Or you can modify the code to work with other libraries\rAfter successfully installing all libraries, change:\nssid* to your networks ID/Name password* to your networks password totalPhotos to number of photos you want to be displayed After you have done all of that, you are ready to upload code to Pico W. You may need to change this code to display your local time, right now it is set to UTC and UTC+1. Wiring #\rConnect your display to SPI0 of your Pico, you may follow this tutorial from electronoobs about connecting ILI9341 to an arduino Connect SD card to SPI1 of Pico Connect DHT11\u0026rsquo;s data pin to pin 5 of your Pico Connect your button to Pico\u0026rsquo;s pin 9 I gave also added a switch on ILI9341\u0026rsquo;s LED line to be able to turn off the screen Creating bitmaps #\rThis is an important step, you have to convert your photos to a 24 bit bitmap. I was using gimp. Here are some important things you have to remember:\nSet height to 320px Set width to 240px When exporting your photo to bitmap (.bmp) remember to export it as a 24 bit bitmap! Otherwise it won\u0026rsquo;t work name your photos starting from 1, e.g. 1.bmp and so on Then upload all your photos to your SD card, on your SD card you should create a folder named Photos. That is the place for all your bitmaps. Case #\rIf you wish, in the repo I have included files for the case I designed and 3D printed. You have .stl files and files for freecad if you want to edit something about them. Keep in mind that it may not suit you.\nUsage #\rWhen pluged in, you should see an Axolotl, current time, day of the week, date, temperature and humidity. This is the main menu screen. To see your photo press the button. Your photo will be displayed. To go back to main menu press the button again. If you wish to change time from winter to summer or summer to winter, hold down the button when in main menu for 2 seconds.\nCredits #\rcode for displaying bitmaps is based on work of Rarday on adafruit forum but with slight modifications so it works getting time from webserver is based on work of tehniq3 on github dht11 library, sadly I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find who made this library, but when I do, I will post it here to give appropriate credits.

So I decided that It will be a great excuse for building this 15kg monstrosity. Also, I wanted my own workstation like this since like 2 year but never had a great enough reason to build it.\nCreations process #\rEvery creation process starts with two things. Searching for inspiration and a lot of money spent. To be transparent, I just call It a Pelican Case, It\u0026rsquo;s not a Peli case. Those are too expensive, what I\u0026rsquo;m using is some noname suitcase for a gun. After my 5mm acrylic arrived I started cutting V-slots to hold everything together inside the suitcase. And I have to say. Tapping 10 holes was a PAIN. It took me like 3 hours and my hands were completely destroyed. Oh, I forgot to mention that It was meant to be EMP proof, but I learned the hard way that this so-called \u0026ldquo;aluminum tape\u0026rdquo; is not conductive at all. It was after covering the whole case in It\u0026hellip; Functions #\rSecond monitor #\rThere is a second 15ish inch screen that serves as a second monitor.\nPower supply #\rA 300W 24V power supply taken from my old Ender 3 and a regulated power supply (1.5-36V)\nEthernet switch #\r5 port one gigabit ethernet switch\nOther #\rThe whole case is controlled by Arduino Nano and some relays. Most important data, like the temp of the power supply is displayed and too beautiful mx cherry switches are used to control everything. Also a 16A breaker is installed, It\u0026rsquo;s also a power switch.\nLast words #\rIt looks simple bc It is. But the size of it made it a nightmare to assemble. That\u0026rsquo;s why it took me 2 months to finish It. Will see if It works as I want in one month, during the hackathon.\\\nNever give up #\r~Simon #\rGallery #\r","date":"30 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/cition/","section":"My Projects","summary":"Totally not a 15kg Pelican Case fitted with overengineered guts to allow for usage totally everywhere!","title":"Cition portable","type":"projects"},{"content":"\rWarning!

It all started when my cousin asked me to repair his RC car bc It\u0026rsquo;s not working anymore. So I did. I added a 12V battery, better H-bridge and LoRa communication between this car and the remote. There were a few problems. There got to be some problems. As I learned, classic Arduino Uno is sometimes the best. ESP 32 is 3v3 based so controlling the H-bridge had to be done via transistors, way too complicated. Arduino pro micro has too small memory capacity and don\u0026rsquo;t even get me started on connecting LoRa modules to them. It was a nightmare. That\u0026rsquo;s why sometimes It\u0026rsquo;s better to go with the classic, especially when you don\u0026rsquo;t need so much CPU power.\nMake your own #\rto make your own, visit its github page (Link above).

No\u0026hellip; Would I do It again? I don\u0026rsquo;t want to. But remember that every project, no matter how challenging will teach you something. This one taught me LoRa.

It was never meant to even exist, but two factors changed my mind: the new Raspberry Pi and the fact that the first Obsium just stopped working. So I ordered Pi5 and waited almost 3 months. It\u0026rsquo;s wild how long It took\u0026hellip; Anyways, while my Pi was being shipped, I ordered M2 hat for it and started work on the design. At first the plan was to use an old case and just modify It, but I ended up creating a whole new case with some tweaks. new (left) and old (right) case comparison\nObsium #\rSpecs #\rObsium mk2 is powered by 8GB version of Raspberry Pi 5 with 512GB Samsung SSD and a 12ish inch Full HD screen.\rBattery #\rBattery is a huge improvement. Mk2 has a replaceable battery and every battery module has It\u0026rsquo;s own 4S bms and 4x2000mAh Li-Ion cells. That gives about 2.5h of work time on a single battery pack.\nKeyboard #\rKeyboard is the same one as on mk1. It\u0026rsquo;s a custom ortholinear keyboard with brown cherry switches. I/Os #\rObsium has rather specific I/O, apart from the obvious ethernet, usb and audio jack, mk2 has an external port for connecting different antennas to built-in SDR. It also has external SATA and a port for powering disk\u0026rsquo;s. With the custom cable connecting HDD drives is no problem. What has changed #\rMany things have changed. Apart from mentioned battery and Pi, the new case is much more comfortable to use, the I/O is also a huge improvement compared to mk1. But what Obsium mk2 lacks compared to mk1 is the integrated LoRa. Last vast improvements are friction hinges. I can\u0026rsquo;t express how much using Obsium has improved with those.\nSecond monitor #\rThanks to having an external 12V port I was able to make a second monitor that could be powered entirely by Obsium. Stats screen #\rAbout a month after finishing Obsium I decided to add a 64x128px OLED display to show me basic stats and the temperature. Can It replace a laptop? #\rNo. Short answer is no. I have been daily driving Obsium for a while. Then I managed to buy a laptop and there are a few things that I have noticed. But before that, a little disclaimer. Comparing cyberdecks to laptops is kinda pointless bc laptops are always gonna be better. Anyway, what I have noticed is that having ARM instead of x86 is a problem. I am not saying that It\u0026rsquo;s a huge issue. But It\u0026rsquo;s a problem, especially for me now when I need to program PLC\u0026rsquo;s and Codesys or TwinCat is only available for x86 windows. Another thing is size, when It sits on a desk or is in a big backpack the thickness is not a problem. But e.g. when I want to take a smaller backpack Obsium takes most of the space. Last thing are thermals. Pi5 has awful thermals and for extended usage at 100% I would be afraid that sth might burn. But apart from that It might be a great computer for somebody that wants to write something from time to time at school or just have the ability to watch a movie or scroll through the internet on a bigger screen and an actual desktop. It\u0026rsquo;s also a great way to learn a lot about electronics, 3D design, linux and more. Last words #\rBoth Obsiums were great projects and I have learned a ton. I definitely won\u0026rsquo;t disassemble this Obsium, It has Its own place in my heart and I just love It too much. Yes, It\u0026rsquo;s not super powerful. Yes, I have a laptop now. But Obsium remains one of my favorite projects.\\\nStay creative and make cyberdecks #\r~Simon #\r","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/obsium-mk2/","section":"My Projects","summary":"Obsium mk2 is an upgraded version of my beloved Obsium.","title":"Obsium mk2","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cyberpet/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cyberpet","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/open-source/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Open Source","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rWarning!

So the functionalities are:\nThermometer and hygrometer Built-in 3W LED Timer and stoper RTC module wifi scanner There are a few not completed functionalities like:\na calculator lora communication but they are not gonna be added.

This project is no longer developed\rGlinek/ATROVEL-arduino_calculator\rArduino based calculator\rC\u0026#43;\u0026#43; 1\r0\rStory #\rIt all started at one of my technical lessons. We were learning arduino\u0026rsquo;s for a while at that moment. And that day\u0026rsquo;s assignment was learning how to read from a 4x4 button matrix. I, knowing a little bit about arduino, was bored a little bit. So to keep myself \u0026ldquo;entertained\u0026rdquo; I started work on a calculator. Nothing serious, not even doing real calculations, just displaying equations on a serial monitor. But then. after 3 hours of making it, I started to wonder. Could I make an actual calculator? I had to know. The same day, after coming back home, every other project went aside and work on this calculator began. My style of working on projects like this is splitting them into two main tasks: programming and case/electronics. And, as always, programming went first. Atrovel\u0026rsquo;s code might be a little bit rough around the edges, and not optimized as much as I would like. Despite that it works. I would even dare to say that It works quite well. Anyways, after a week of coding and debugging. The code was done and now I had to start working on the enclosure. My first idea was using MX cherry switches but after 5h long print this case turned out waaaaay too big. So I decided on using the original 4x4 button matrix with two additional ones. After stuffing all the electronics inside and closing It with a little amount of force (jk, a lot of force\u0026hellip;) and super glue, came the time to test It. And oh boy have I tested It. One month of using it in school while doing math and physics exams. And all the calculations were correct.\nProblems #\rThere are two main problems with Atrovel. The buttons are kinda shitty, and you have to remember the layout. Another thing is that you are unable to calculate e.g. 2+2 and then make a square root of it. You have to type 4 and then press square root. Will I fix those? Probably not. But Atrovel\u0026rsquo;s spaghetti code will probably be used in another iteration of Otsi\nMaking your own #\rTo create your own Atrovel, just follow the instructions on It\u0026rsquo;s github (link above). If you decide to make your own, I hope it will serve you well. And if you want, you can send your finished calculator to me. I would be delighted to see It\nGallery #\rStay creative #\r~Simon #\r","date":"15 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/atrovel-calculator/","section":"My Projects","summary":"Atrovel calculator is a project that originated from one of my schools lessons.","title":"Atrovel calculator","type":"projects"},{"content":"\rLinks #\rWallpaper Hackaday.io page Hackster.io\u0026rsquo;s article Cyberdeck Cafe\u0026rsquo;s website Cyberdeck Cafe\u0026rsquo;s discord yarh.io - the keyboard design But why? #\rLet\u0026rsquo;s start with a little bit of story behind creating Obsium. It\u0026rsquo;s not my first deck, in fact it\u0026rsquo;s my 8th deck. But why make so many isn\u0026rsquo;t it easier to buy a laptop? - you may ask. Yes it is but the reason for building decks for past 2 years and spending all my money on it was to built something that fits all MY needs and maybe learn something while doing it. So i decided that my last deck has to have:\na big-ish battery exposed gpio my digital oscilloscope LoRa (Long Range messenger) sdr And it has to be flexible. All my previous decks have failed at at least one of this points. But now I\u0026rsquo;ve a deck with all that features (not all i wanted at the beginning but all I mentioned). Yes it\u0026rsquo;s big and Yes laptops are more powerful and I probably could have got away with just taking an additional Arduino with me all the time but i am a masochist that has a 3d printer and some skills. Fusion360 go brrrrr #\rDesigning process wasn\u0026rsquo;t as easy as i have hopped. What i have right now is the second version of Obsium. The first one was cooler but not practical at all. So in the middle of printing and designing I scraped everything and started all over again. I have hoped that my last deck would be thinner but i didn\u0026rsquo;t want to order another PCB and wait another month. Besides that current design incorporates (in my opinion) everything pretty well. old design\nnew design\nI need more I/O #\rOn the left side I have charging port for my custom charger, main switch to power Obsium on and a button to turn on and off the display. The back side has one battery indicator, antena for LoRa and one removable panel with ports and gpios.\rThe right side has a fan switch and is going to have an antena for 100MHz-1GHz SDR And finally the front, It has a label and 2 Allen keys Looking at it from the top you can see a fan, an offset keyboard and a small, not even 1inch LCD.\rA huge time saviour while making Obsium turned out to be using plexi for everything large and flat. It also made Obsium really rigged although i won\u0026rsquo;t throw it around.\nThe inside #\rThe inside might look, at first glance, as one big mess but It\u0026rsquo;s actually a well organized and thought through arrangement of cables. Another huge savior is the PCB I\u0026rsquo;m using cause it allows for a lot of connections (just like every PCB\u0026hellip;) without any extra mess. Although if I could turn back time I would do It differently, sadly from the back ports only the Ethernet is working. Theoretically HDMI is also working but, there has to be some lose connection cause it sometimes lacks a few colors. Also the USB is working but as 2.0 and not 3.0. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why the ports have failed, I have checked all of them before putting this board inside but It still managed to break itself. Now I have to live with that. Specs #\rObsium is powered by a rather unusual raspberry pi 400 board with a M.2 SSD connected via USB 3.0. Powering everything is battery pack made out of 4 Li-ion cells in 4s configuration giving around 40Wh and 16.8V. As a keyboard Obsium is using custom made ortholinear design and configuration by yarh.io but with a few tweaks. Last words #\rFor the next few weeks i\u0026rsquo;m going to be debugging this deck. I have to check GPIO\u0026rsquo;s, LoRa, oscilloscope (that\u0026rsquo;s what the Raspberry Pi Pico is for), SDR and the mini LCD.

Tbh I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I have decided to make It, I have never actually used it besides while testing it for the contest.\nHow it works #\rOne-key keyboard (or okk. for short) works by measuring how much light is emitted by the LED onto a photoresistor, while the key is not pressed, the LED is not covered so all the light can shine onto the photoresistor. But when it is pressed by some amount, the key starts blocking some of the light so the photoresistor\u0026rsquo;s resistance changes. And when this photoresistor is connected with another one, and voltage divider is created by them. You can measure this resistance difference (or, to be more accurate, now a voltage drop) with arduino\u0026rsquo;s analog pin. The code can be as short as just a few lines. Additionally I have added another screen, cause It makes okk. look better and also everything nowadays has to have a screen.\nMake your own #\rWhy would you even want to make your own version?
